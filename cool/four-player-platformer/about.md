## Still in alpha, simply a test right now

## Instructions

Nothing to do right now besides moving around. It's just a proof of concept for now. Trying to see if using one big stage is a good idea

### Player 1

Use WASD to move

### Player 2

Use Arrow Keys to move

### Player 3

Use 8456 on the num pad (Also like WASD)

### Player 4

Use IJKL to move (It's like WASD)
