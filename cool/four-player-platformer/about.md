## Still in alpha, simply a test right now

## Instructions
Nothing to do right now besides moving around. It's just a proof of concept for now...
### Player 1

Use WASD to move

### Player 2

Use Arrow Keys to move

### Player 3

Use IJKL to move (It's like WASD)

### Player 4

Use 8456 on the num pad (Also like WASD)
